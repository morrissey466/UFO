# UFO Analysis 

## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this week's challenge was to use javascript to construct a webpage that will allow users to reference UFO sightings and do a basic filter of the data on several parameters. 

## Results

We constructed a website with a brief explanation of UFO sightings and a table of historical sightings. Users can use any of the five filters (date, city, state, country, and shape) to narrow down the results of the sightings. The website also has the functionality to use multiple filters at the same time. The filters auto update as the user changes the criteria. A user can narrow down the sightings to better find what exactly they are looking for.

The two images above show how the filters work. The top picture shows the unfiltered table, and the bottom shows the table results with multiple filters used. All or none of the filters can be used, and the table will respond accordingly. 

## Summary 

All in all the data collected does not have a lot of consistency, and the filters are touchy. If the user uses the wrong date format the table will show no results. Cities and states are often in lowercase. The website would benefit with some data clean up. The website could use some more formatting so it centers better with different widths. Though I think as is the website is overall useful to research sightings.
